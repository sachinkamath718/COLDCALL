═══ EXAMPLE 2 — ECOMMERCE (Meesho) ═══
Greetings Syed,
I hope you're doing well.
I'm reaching out from Zeliot–Condense, a deep-tech real-time data platform backed by Bosch. We work with high-scale digital and mobility companies to simplify real-time data pipelines while significantly reducing the infrastructure and operational complexity of streaming data systems.
Given the scale at which Meesho operates its marketplace and analytics workloads, I thought this might be highly relevant for your team.
Today, many high-growth platforms rely on a mix of Kafka, CDC pipelines, event streams, and multiple ingestion tools to move operational data into analytics platforms. While powerful, these stacks often introduce challenges around pipeline sprawl, high cloud costs, operational overhead, and delays in making data usable for analytics and AI use cases.
Condense is designed to address exactly this problem. It acts as a real-time data platform that simplifies ingestion, transformation, and serving of high-volume event streams, enabling analytics teams to operationalize real-time data at scale without managing complex infrastructure.
For marketplace platforms like Meesho, we typically see strong impact in areas such as:
Real-time order and seller analytics – Streaming operational data from transaction systems into analytics platforms in real time to enable faster visibility into order flows, seller performance, and marketplace health.
Customer behavior and funnel analytics – Capturing and processing high-volume app and web events to power real-time dashboards, experimentation frameworks, and personalization engines.
Fraud and anomaly detection – Streaming transaction and activity data to identify suspicious behavior, payment anomalies, or operational risks instantly rather than hours later.
Operational intelligence for logistics and fulfillment – Enabling real-time monitoring of logistics events, delivery pipelines, and fulfillment operations to quickly detect bottlenecks or service disruptions.
Many teams we work with have been able to reduce their streaming infrastructure and data pipeline costs by 40–50%, while significantly simplifying the engineering effort required to maintain these pipelines.

- Case Studies: https://www.zeliot.in/blog
- About Zeliot:  www.zeliot.in/quick-links

I would love to explore whether there might be an opportunity to support [Company]'s analytics platform with real-time data capabilities or help optimize parts of the current streaming architecture.
Would you be open to a 30 minute conversation sometime next week?
Looking forward to connecting.

═══ EXAMPLE 3 — RETAIL/GCP (AutoZone) ═══
Greetings Mr. Pranjal,
It was a pleasure connecting with you. I wanted to introduce Zeliot Condense, a Bosch-backed deep-tech company — a real-time data engineering platform that is being adopted and backed through strategic engagements with Bosch for large-scale connected mobility and enterprise data initiatives.
Condense is a backend, cloud-native data foundation that operates beneath existing enterprise systems, analytics platforms, and AI/ML workflows. Its primary role is to standardize, govern, and reliably move high-velocity operational data across vehicles, devices, and infrastructure — without requiring changes to existing applications, models, or business logic.
Given your role as a GCP Data Engineer at AutoZone, I believe Condense can complement your existing GCP architecture by acting as a scalable, low-latency streaming backbone that integrates seamlessly with services such as BigQuery, GCS, Pub/Sub, and analytics layers.
Below are a few relevant use cases where Condense can add value:
- Real-Time Inventory & Stock Visibility – Stream updates from POS systems, warehouse systems, and distribution centers into a unified pipeline to enable near real-time inventory reconciliation, low-stock alerts, and cross-location availability tracking.
- Supply Chain & Logistics Monitoring – Ingest telemetry and order-status updates from multiple systems to provide live tracking of shipments, SLA monitoring, and exception handling with event-driven alerts.
- Pricing & Promotion Intelligence – Enable real-time price updates, campaign triggers, and rule-based adjustments by streaming transactional and competitive pricing data directly into analytics systems.
- Customer & Order Analytics – Capture order events, browsing behavior, and transaction streams in real time to power recommendation engines, fraud detection, and operational dashboards.
- Simplified Streaming Operations on GCP – Instead of managing complex Kafka clusters or stitching together multiple Pub/Sub flows, Condense provides: managed topic and retention control, built-in transformation and enrichment layer, easier connector deployment, better observability across throughput and pipeline performance.
- Streaming to BigQuery / Data Lake – Condense can write structured, partitioned data directly to analytics storage layers, enabling both real-time analytics and historical processing without additional ETL overhead.
By reducing operational complexity and centralizing real-time ingestion and transformation, Condense helps data engineering teams focus on building reliable, scalable data products rather than maintaining streaming infrastructure.
As a pre-read, sharing the below information on Condense.

- Replace company names, use cases, and tech stack with ones specific to the prospect from research
- Use "Greetings [Name]," opener always
- MANDATORY: Every email_body MUST include this exact pre-read block, word for word, after the use cases and before the social proof paragraph:

As a pre-read, sharing the below information on Condense.
- Condense Overview: https://docs.zeliot.in/condense
- Case Studies: https://www.zeliot.in/blog
- About Zeliot:  www.zeliot.in/quick-links
- Get Started with Condense: https://bit.ly/3NmxJpe
Omitting this block is a HARD ERROR. It must appear in every email_body without exception.
- Total length: 350-500 words
- No asterisks, no markdown, no bold in email body
- Sign-off: Do NOT include any signature, "Best regards", name, title, company or phone at the end of any email. End the email with the closing sentence only.

REMINDER: Para 1 = Condense intro only. Para 2 = their role + company. This order is MANDATORY.
SPACING: Always separate paragraphs with a blank line (double newline \n\n). Never run paragraphs together without a blank line between them.
email_followup1: 3-4 short paragraphs. Send 3 days after the first email.
   DO NOT start with "Greetings" or any salutation — start directly with the content.
   Take a completely different angle from email_body — reference a tech signal 
   OR recent company news OR a relevant success story metric (e.g. "40% TCO reduction", 
   "99.95% uptime"). Never mention job openings. No signature at end.
   End with soft CTA for 30 mins next week.
   email_followup2: 2-3 short paragraphs. Final nudge, 7 days after first email.
   DO NOT start with "Greetings" or any salutation — start directly with the content.
   Reference one specific Condense outcome metric. Keep door open — no desperation. 
   Never mention job openings. No signature at end.

GLOBAL RULE FOR ALL 9 OUTPUTS: Never reference job openings, hiring signals, 
or open positions in any message — LinkedIn or email. Use tech signals, 
recent news, success story metrics, or persona pain points instead.

3. PAIN POINTS with current stack: 4 specific pains a ${persona} at ${company} faces with ${stack} + ${tool} at scale
4. WHY CONDENSE FITS: How exactly Condense complements or replaces parts of their ${stack}/${tool} stack. Be specific — e.g. "Condense can replace their Kafka Connect layer with managed connectors" or "Condense reduces their Confluent licensing cost by 40%"
5. CONDENSE FIT SCORE: "high", "medium", or "low". High = active Kafka/streaming usage + scale + data engineering needs. Explain why.
6. TECH SIGNALS: What signals indicate they are a good fit (job postings patterns, engineering blog, tech stack choices)
7. RECENT NEWS: Search "${company} news 2025 2026" — funding, product launches, expansions, data initiatives
8. CONVERSATION HOOKS: 2 specific hooks for ${persona} based on their ${stack} + ${integration}

═══ REAL EXAMPLE — WHATFIX (SaaS/Data Platform) ═══
Subject: Condense — Complementing Whatfix's Kafka data platform for scale and cost efficiency

Dear Swadesh,
Greetings.!

I'm reaching out to introduce Condense, a deep-tech real-time data platform from Zeliot, backed by Bosch.

Today, platforms like Whatfix typically rely on Kafka-based architectures using tools such as Kafka, Fivetran, Airbyte, Hevo, Striim, Apache Spark / Apache Flink, and warehouses like Snowflake or Amazon Redshift. Teams often add tools like RudderStack or Segment, along with Kafka Connect or Debezium for CDC pipelines to move data across systems. While powerful, this results in multiple pipeline layers, higher infrastructure overhead, and rising total costs.

Condense complements this by simplifying and optimizing streaming pipelines, with a strong focus on cost efficiency:

- Reduce Kafka infrastructure costs – optimize compute, storage, and data movement for high-volume workloads
- Lower total cost of ownership (TCO) – consolidate ingestion, processing, and delivery into a single platform, reducing spend across multiple tools, licensing, and operational overhead
- Enable in-stream transformations – process, filter, and enrich data directly within the stream for faster insights and fewer downstream resources
- Simplify ingestion and CDC layers – eliminate the need for multiple connectors and pipelines
- Ensure reliable, low-latency delivery – consistently move data to analytics and operational systems in real time

As a pre-read, sharing the below information on Condense.
- Condense Overview: https://docs.zeliot.in/condense
- Case Studies: https://www.zeliot.in/blog
- About Zeliot: www.zeliot.in/quick-links
- Get Started with Condense: https://www.zeliot.in/try-now

Given Whatfix's focus on real-time analytics and fraud detection, this could be highly relevant — especially in optimizing both performance and cost.

Can we schedule a quick 30-minute call to understand your current architecture and identify where Condense can help optimize performance and cost?

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Thanks & Regards,
Veera Raghavan
Head of Enterprise Sales

═══ END REAL EXAMPLE ═══

NOW generate for ${company} following this EXACT structure:

PARA 1: Start with "Hi ${firstName || "there"}," then a blank line, then the Condense intro. Use the EXACT name "${firstName || "there"}" — never write [Prospect Name] or any placeholder., then: "I'm reaching out to introduce Condense, a deep-tech real-time data platform from Zeliot, backed by Bosch."

PARA 2 (MANDATORY — NEVER SKIP): "Today, platforms like ${company} typically rely on Kafka-based architectures using tools such as [LIST ALL: ${stack}, ${tool}, and infer related tools like Apache Spark / Apache Flink, Kafka Connect, Debezium], and warehouses like [${warehouse}]. Teams often add tools like [infer: RudderStack, Segment, or similar] for ${integration.toLowerCase()}, along with Kafka Connect or Debezium for CDC pipelines. While powerful, this results in multiple pipeline layers, higher infrastructure overhead, and rising total costs."

PARA 3: "Condense complements this by simplifying and optimizing streaming pipelines, with a strong focus on cost efficiency:"

BULLETS (4-5 specific to ${integration}):
- Each bullet must be specific to their exact stack and integration opportunity
- Format: "- [Title] – [description specific to their stack/use case]"
- Always include: TCO reduction, in-stream transformations, CDC simplification, reliable delivery

PRE-READ BLOCK (MANDATORY — NEVER OMIT — WORD FOR WORD):
As a pre-read, sharing the below information on Condense.
- Condense Overview: https://docs.zeliot.in/condense
- Case Studies: https://www.zeliot.in/blog
- About Zeliot: www.zeliot.in/quick-links
- Get Started with Condense: https://www.zeliot.in/try-now

PARA 4: "Given ${company}'s focus on ${integration.toLowerCase()}, this could be highly relevant — especially in optimizing both performance and cost."

CTA: "Can we schedule a quick 30-minute call to understand your current architecture and identify where Condense can help optimize performance and cost?"

CLOSING: "Looking forward to your thoughts."

Do NOT include any sign-off, signature, name, phone or email at the end. End with the closing sentence only.

CRITICAL RULES — VIOLATION = WRONG OUTPUT:
1. ALWAYS name ALL tools from their stack explicitly in Para 2 — ${stack}, ${tool}, AND infer Kafka Connect, Debezium, Spark/Flink if Kafka is involved. Never generic.
2. Pre-read block is MANDATORY every single time — exact links, exact format
3. Greeting is ALWAYS "Greetings [FirstName]"
4. Bullets must reference their SPECIFIC ${integration} — never copy-paste generic bullets
5. Subject line: "Condense — Complementing ${company}'s ${stack.includes("Kafka") ? "Kafka" : "streaming"} data platform for scale and cost efficiency"

ALSO generate:
- connection_note: Max 300 chars, warm, reference their data stack, no pitch
- day0_message: 80-120 words, reference their exact stack (${stack} + ${tool}), one CTA
- day3_followup: 50-80 words. MUST start with "Hi ${firstName ? firstName : ""},\n\n" then different angle — reference ${warehouse} or ${cloud}
- day7_followup: 30-50 words. MUST start with "Hi ${firstName ? firstName : ""},\n\n" then reference a Condense metric
- day14_followup: 20-35 words. MUST start with "Hi ${firstName ? firstName : ""},\n\n" then final nudge
- email_followup1: ...same as before but also MUST start with "Hi ${firstName ? firstName : ""},\n\n"
- email_followup2: ...same as before but also MUST start with "Hi ${firstName ? firstName : ""},\n\n"


Return ONLY valid JSON:
